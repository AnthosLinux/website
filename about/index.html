            <h2 class="title">About Anthos Linux</h2>
            <p>
                Anthos Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general purpose GNU/Linux
                distribution versatile enough to suit any role. Development focuses on
                simplicity, minimalism, and code elegance. Anthos is installed as a
                minimal base system, configured by the user upon which their own ideal
                environment is assembled by installing only what is required or desired
                for their unique purposes. GUI configuration utilities are not officially
                provided, and most system configuration is performed from the shell by editing
                simple text files. Anthos strives to stay bleeding edge, and typically offers
                the latest stable versions of most software.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anthos Linux uses its own Pacman package manager, which couples simple binary
                packages with an easy-to-use package build system. This allows users to
                easily manage and customize packages ranging from official Anthos software to the
                user's own personal packages to packages from 3rd party sources. The repository
                system also allows users to easily build and maintain their own custom build
                scripts, packages, and repositories, encouraging community growth and
                contribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The minimal Anthos base package set resides in the streamlined [core] repository.
                In addition, the official [extra], [extra-testing], and [core-testing] repositories
                provide several thousand high-quality packages to meet your software demands.
                Anthos also offers the Anthos Linux User Repository (AUR), which contains more than
                49,000 build scripts, for compiling installable packages from source using the
                Anthos Linux makepkg application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anthos Linux uses a "rolling release" system which allows one-time installation
                and perpetual software upgrades. It is not generally necessary to reinstall
                or upgrade your Anthos Linux system from one "version" to the next.
                By issuing one command, an Anthos system is kept up-to-date and on the bleeding
                edge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anthos strives to keep its packages as close to the original upstream software as
                possible. Patches are applied only when necessary to ensure an application
                compiles and runs correctly with the other packages installed on an up-to-date
                Anthos system.
            </p>
            <p>
                To summarize: Anthos Linux is a versatile, and simple distribution designed to
                fit the needs of the competent Linux&#0174; user. It is both powerful and easy
                to manage, making it an ideal distro for servers and workstations. Take it in
                any direction you like. If you share this vision of what a GNU/Linux
                distribution should be, then you are welcomed and encouraged to use it freely,
                get involved, and contribute to the community. Welcome to Arch!
